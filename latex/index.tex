\section*{fctransfer }

Basic transfer (upload/download) functions to easily allow simpler tools to share config, content, and data.

This project is taken from fctools' section that allows it to checksum-\/upload a large data archive using only a U\-R\-L and a filename.

For example, given a target U\-R\-L ({\tt ftp\-://scott\-:tiger@ftp.\-example.\-com/sub/dir/}) and one or more files (ie data.\-zip), the library\-: 1) calculates a checksum 2) uploads the checksum as \{file\}.sum (in our example, a data.\-zip.\-sum file would be sent) 3) uploads the file (in our example, data.\-zip)

The uploaded checksum intentionally matches the checksum file used in ages-\/old traditional \char`\"{}sum\char`\"{} command; this is the same as the \char`\"{}cksum\char`\"{} command.

An additional intention of sharing this content is to\-: 1) reduce the time it takes Y\-O\-U, the next developer, in uploading/sharing content 2) emphasize better practices\-: checksums, people, they're really cool things 3) expand to provide an interface to additional upload U\-R\-L protocols\-: cifs\-://, etc.

Please post your enhancements as pull-\/requests! If I'm your upstream, share upwards!
