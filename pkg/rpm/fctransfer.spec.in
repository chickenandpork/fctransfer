%description
Tools and Resources collected from my "fctools" project (nee "vitools") to allow easier checksum-upload a large data archive using only a URL and a filename.

For example, given a target URL (ftp://scott:tiger@ftp.example.com/sub/dir/) and one or more files (ie data.zip), the library:
1) calculates a checksum
2) uploads the checksum as .sum (in our example, a data.zip.sum file would be sent)
3) uploads the file (in our example, data.zip)

The uploaded checksum intentionally matches the checksum file used in ages-old traditional "sum" command; this is the same as the "cksum" command.

An additional intention of sharing this content is to:
1) reduce the time it takes YOU, the next developer, in uploading/sharing content
2) emphasize better practices: checksums, people, they're really cool things
3) expand to provide an interface to additional upload URL protocols: cifs://, etc.
